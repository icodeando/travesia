## Travesia

I built this application to showcase random photos I took in 2016 while exploring New York City. 

**Link to project:** https://travesia.netlify.app/

### How it's made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript.

- Design by HTML5. 

- Deployed to Netlify.


### Optimizations

- I would add a description to each photo.
- I would link each photo to its location on Google Maps.
- I would add more photos from recent years to the portfolio.
- I would separate the portfolio by year and season.
